AutoSpot
=====

A command-line Spotify-client based on Pyspotify2.
We have two branches, one where the player is controlled by the computers 
keyboard and one where the player is controlled by physical buttons.

It also use a LCD connected via I2C to diplay info.
The setup for this is described at http://think-bowl.com/raspberry-pi/i2c-python-library-lcd-with-the-raspberry-pi/

For some reason Raspberry:s Rpi.gpio (for working with the Gpio) doesn't
work with Curses (which is used to enable keyboard control). 

Dependencies:
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev python-dev python-alsaaudio
(sudo dnf install libffi-devel python-devel python-alsaaudio)

sudo easy_install3 -U RPIO
sudo pip-3.2 install pyalsaaudio
(sudo pip install pyalsaaudio)

Some notes on operatingsystem for the Pi. I still have to find the best system, it should boot quick! Buildroot-rpi is doing that, 
but it's hard to build to support libspotify. Arch Linux boots in 13 seconds to command line, good. Tiny Core, small but slow to load 
due to the system with dynamically loading extensions. 

Arch Linux:
pacman -S python2-pip gcc alsa-lib wget make tk
pip2 install pyalsaaudio
wget https://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-12.1.103-Linux-armv6-bcm2708hardfp-release.tar.gz
tar zxvf libspotify*
cd libspotify*
make install prefix=/usr/local
pip2 install pyspotify
Create symbolic link: ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python
Edit /etc/ld.so.conf, add "/usr/local/lib"
Run ldconfig
nano settings.py
Add:
username="YourUsername"
password="YourPassword"
Save

SPI & Gpio permissions:
groupadd spi
groupadd gpio
usermod -aG spi alarm
usermod -aG gpio alarm
nano /etc/udev/rules.d/raspberrypi.rules
