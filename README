AutoSpot
=====

A command-line Spotify-client based on Pyspotify2.
We have two branches, one where the player is controlled by the computers 
keyboard and one where the player is controlled by physical buttons.

It also use a LCD connected via I2C to diplay info.
The setup for this is described at http://think-bowl.com/raspberry-pi/i2c-python-library-lcd-with-the-raspberry-pi/

For some reason Raspberry:s Rpi.gpio (for working with the Gpio) doesn't
work with Curses (which is used to enable keyboard control). 

Dependencies:
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev python-dev python-alsaaudio

sudo easy_install3 -U RPIO
sudo pip-3.2 install pyalsaaudio
