AutoSpot
=====

A command-line Spotify-client based on Pyspotify2.
We have two branches, one where the player is controlled by the computers 
keyboard and one where the player is controlled by physical buttons.
For some reason Raspberry:s Rpi.gpio (for working with the Gpio) doesn't
work with Curses (which is used to enable keyboard control).

sudo apt-get install libffi-dev python-dev python-alsaaudio
