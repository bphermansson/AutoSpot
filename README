It has three different guis: Text, graphical on computer screen and graphical with a small 2.2" TFT (Raspberry Pi only).

(sudo dnf install libffi-devel python-devel python-alsaaudio)

sudo easy_install3 -U RPIO - necessery?	

sudo pip-3.2 install pyalsaaudio

Some notes on operatingsystem for the Pi. I still have to find the best system, it should boot quick! Buildroot-rpi is doing that, 
but it's hard to build to support libspotify. Arch Linux boots in 13 seconds to command line, good. Tiny Core, small but slow to load 
due to the system with dynamically loading extensions. 

Arch Linux:
pacman -S python2-pip gcc alsa-lib wget make tk
pip2 install pyalsaaudio
wget https://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-12.1.103-Linux-armv6-bcm2708hardfp-release.tar.gz
tar zxvf libspotify*
cd libspotify*
make install prefix=/usr/local
pip2 install pyspotify
Create symbolic link: ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python
Edit /etc/ld.so.conf, add "/usr/local/lib"
Run ldconfig
nano settings.py
Add:
username="YourUsername"
password="YourPassword"
Save
Run 'A2.py'
